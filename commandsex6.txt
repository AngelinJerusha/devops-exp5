To learn how to create, view, update, and delete Kubernetes resources using the command-line tool kubectl.

🧩 Prerequisites

✅ Install kubectl

choco install kubernetes-cli -y


✅ Install Minikube

choco install minikube -y


✅ Verify installations

kubectl version --client
minikube version

🚀 Step 1: Start a Local Cluster
minikube start


Wait a few minutes — it will create a single-node local Kubernetes cluster inside a VM or Docker.

🧱 Step 2: Create a Deployment File

Create a file k8s-deploy.yaml anywhere (e.g., C:\k8s-lab\k8s-deploy.yaml) with this content:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: flask
        image: <dockerhub-username>/flask-lab:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flask-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: flask
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 5000
  type: NodePort


⚠️ Replace <dockerhub-username> with your Docker Hub username.
If you don’t have a Flask image, I can give you a 4-line Dockerfile to build and push one.

⚙️ Step 3: Apply (Create) the Resources
kubectl apply -f C:\k8s-lab\k8s-deploy.yaml


Expected output:

deployment.apps/flask-deploy created
service/flask-service created

🔍 Step 4: View Resources
kubectl get pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services

📖 Step 5: Describe and View Logs
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>


You’ll see container details, events, and logs from your Flask app.

📈 Step 6: Scale the Deployment
kubectl scale deployment flask-deploy --replicas=3


Then verify:

kubectl get pods


You should now see 3 running pods.

🧹 Step 7: Delete Resources
kubectl delete -f C:\k8s-lab\k8s-deploy.yaml

🌐 (Optional) Step 8: Access the App
minikube service flask-service


This opens your browser to the running Flask app inside the Minikube cluster.

✅ Observation

You successfully created, viewed, scaled, and deleted Kubernetes resources using CLI commands.

📄 Result

Successfully deployed and managed Kubernetes resources (Pods, Deployment, and Service) using kubectl commands on a local Minikube cluster.
